Week 7 Assignment: Books web site

- Write a multi page website, using bookdb.py
- Index page is a list of books, link to a detail page per book
- Each detail page displays info about one book
- Use any Python tech youâ€™d like

(from Brian Dorsey's Internet Programming in Python, Winter 2011)

Hints:

Figure out how to pass variables to templates and how to display variables in
templates (using jinja2).

See quickstart flask docs for basic info about templates, but will have to
read in a little more detail on how to deal with lists of stuff.

This is going to require understanding the jinja2 control language,
specifically the looping construct.

Then we're most of the way through.  At that point, missing only a way to pass
a link from one page to the other.  Use persistence, get a handler that can
deal with info about any id, then can pass to any template.  Squint at the
quickstart, there should be enough info in there.
