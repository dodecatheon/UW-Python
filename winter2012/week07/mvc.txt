Web applications are projects

  Multiple files, packages, etc.
  Advanced coding idioms: decorators etc.
  Systematic testing

  Would like some organizing principles, "design patterns"

MVC architecure - Model, View, Controller

 Motivation: Separate content from (visual) design
    might have lots of different ways to view the same data
  Keep the model (application data) and the views (web pages) independent

 Model: application data, Python global variables, database ...
 View: web pages, templates ...
 Controller: URL routing ...

 Flask "view functions": decorated with @app.route, generate pages

+--

Testing

  Test without browser or server, automated test execution
   Standard:  Execute application functions "by hand" or with unittest...
    BUT application functions depend on HTTP requests/responses via server
   Framework:  simulate HTTP request/response without server

   (demo echo_tests.py)
